This project is an SPA to be used with the [Mockiato](https://github.com/Optum/mockiato) web-based service virtualization platform.  It's goal is to provide
a user-centric experience and stream-line the presentation and modification of information in the Mockiato system.  It is intended as a replacement for the 
rudimentary system-focused UI delivered with the system.

This README has information about contributing to this project and how it is organized.
