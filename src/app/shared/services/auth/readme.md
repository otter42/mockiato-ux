## Authentication Services

The initial implementation leverages Auth0's capabilities for SSO and other 
authentication stores.  It will be supplemented with additional implementations
that can be selected via configuration parameters -- i.e. a dummy module for local
development which can work in offline mode.

## Auth0 Integration

The values current in the auth0-variables file are intended for use by Tenebris Development Studio only.
Any forks of this repository should replace the values with appropriate keys
or use another authentication service implementation.
